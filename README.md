# Linked List Operations - Menu Driven Program
## add() - insert() - delete() - count() - display()

Linked list is an ordered set of nodes, whereas nodes contains the data it holds and the pointer which points to the next node - either null or the Node's address.

Note: you can only access the desired nodes in the list by accessing the each nodes from left to right (head to tail) or right to left (tail to head), until you find your desired node.

This code implemented singly linked list. head to the last node (last node is identified if its pointer points to null).

This is a menu-driven program in which user chooses among given options - display, add, insert, delete, count nodes, or exit the program.

display - display the nodes' data avaialable in the linked list.
add - append the new node with data in the list.
insert - add and insert the new node in the given position within 1 to list.count(), if list has nodes.
delete - unlinks the node in the list and deletes it from the memory given the position.
count - count and returns the number of nodes in the list.
